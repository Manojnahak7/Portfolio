        <p>
          Hello! I'm Manoj, a passionate web developer with experience in
          building responsive and user-friendly websites and applications. I
          specialize in React, JavaScript, and backend development using Spring
          Boot. I love solving problems and creating seamless digital
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, learning
          about UI/UX design, and contributing to open-source projects.
        </p>
